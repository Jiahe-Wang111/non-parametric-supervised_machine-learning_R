# non-parametric-supervised_machine-learning_R
The focus is on non-parametric models, exploring how they handle prediction tasks where relationships may be non-linear or high-dimensional. Compared with parametric approaches (e.g., logistic regression, GAMs), these methods make fewer distributional assumptions and directly learn patterns from the data.
